* Step 1: Initial Setup
**Project Initialization

**Create a new project directory.

Initialize a version control system (Git) and connect it to a repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

**Set Up the Development Environment

Install and configure your preferred full-stack framework (e.g., Django, Flask for Python; Express for Node.js; Ruby on Rails for Ruby).

Install SQLite3 Database and set up your development environment to use it.

***Step 2: Back-End Development
**Design the Database Schema

*Define tables for flashcards, sets, collections, users, ratings, and telemetry data.
Flashcards:  id, quesiton, answer
Sets: id, sets_type 
user: id, user_name not null, user_type (admin, standard) not null
Ratings: id, rate_type (five type star)
Telemetry data: id, event_type, user_id FK, additional_info

*Write SQL scripts or use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to create these tables.

**Develop the API

Define the endpoints based on the API specification provided.

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for flashcards, sets, and collections.

Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Implement Limitations

Add logic to limit the creation of flashcard sets to 20 per day.

Implement an admin interface to change this limit dynamically.

***Step 3: Front-End Development
**Set Up the Front-End Framework

Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).

Initialize the front-end project and configure it to interact with the back-end API.

**Create the User Interface

Design the UI for browsing and creating flashcard collections and sets.

Ensure the answer is hidden by default and only revealed by user input (e.g., clicking on the card).

***Step 4: Integrate the Front-End with the Back-End
Connect Front-End to API

Use fetch or Axios to make API calls from the front-end to the back-end.

Implement functions to handle data fetching, submission, and updating.

***Step 5: Implement Future Milestones
**Additional Features

Add functionality to mark certain cards as hidden by individual students.

Implement a rating system with reviews and a five-star rating system for card sets and collections.

Develop a telemetry system to track quiz attempts and completion times.

Implement AI-based recommendations for sets using collected telemetry data.

***Step 6: Testing
**Automated Testing

**Write unit tests for both back-end and front-end components.

**Implement end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions.

**Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, PyTest for Python) and set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

***Manual Testing

Conduct manual testing to ensure the application functions as expected.

Test the user interface and API endpoints thoroughly.

***Step 7: Documentation
Document Your Code

***Add comments and documentation to your code.

Create API documentation to help other developers understand how to use the endpoints.

Prepare a User Guide

Write a user guide explaining how to use the application, create flashcard sets, and study them.

Step 8: Deployment
Deploy the Application

Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure).

Set up the server environment and deploy both the front-end and back-end applications.

Ensure the database is correctly configured and accessible.
